### Blockchain Software Engineering with Ethereum

<p>
    This repository contains work done as a part of UBC's blockchain software engineering course. We made use of truffle for compiling smart contracts and ganache as a test blockchain for our smart contracts. The contracts were written in Solidity. Testing was done use chai assertion javascript library. The end goal is to design a ReactJs application with blockchain acting as the backend.
